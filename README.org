**** How do we handle reading if we use org-mode-parser which only handles reading and parsing?
     We will probably have to try just writing out the orgnode list
     from the parse and recreate the whole file.  Realistically we'd
     have to recreate parts of the file anyways because some entries
     would be entered mid file, but still I'm concerned about the loss
     of data risk if the parser doesn't read in everything properly.
